Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police! Knocking sounds man what you need? Police open out! Aww shit We have a warrant for ' s arrest Get down and put your hands right where I can see ' em! Move motherfucker move now! What the fuck did I do man? What did I do?

Maybe it is because I kick so much butt I kick ass or maybe ‘ cause I blast On a stupid ass nigga when i am playing with the trigger Of an Uzi or an AK ‘ Cause the police always got something stupid to say They put out my picture with silence ‘ Cause my identity by itself causes violence The E with the criminal behavior i am a gangsta but still I got flavor Without a gun and a badge what do you got? A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot By me or another nigga And with a gat it do not matter if he is smaller or bigger Size do not mean shit he is from the old school fool! And as you all know E 's here to rule Whenever i am rolling keep looking in the mirror And ears on cue so I can hear a Dumb motherfucker with a gun And if i am rolling off the 8 he will be the one That I take out and then get away While i am driving off laughing this is what i will say Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police! The verdict: The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck White bread chickenshit motherfucker Wait that is a lie! that is a goddamn lie!

Hank Williams,Country,"Cold, Cold Heart",Memorial Album,I tried so hard my dear to show that you are my every dream Yet you are afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart Why can not I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart? Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue And so my heart is paying now for things I did not do In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start Why can not I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart? you will never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry You know you need and want my love yet you are afraid to try Why do you run and hide from life to try it just am not smart Why can not I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart? There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart Why can not I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart?,"['Nostalgia', 'Sadness', 'Tenderness', 'Tension']"

Nickelback,Rock,If Today Was Your Last Day,Dark Horse,My best friend gave me the best advice He said each day 's a gift and not a given right Leave no stone unturned leave your fears behind And try to take the path less traveled by That first step you take is the longest stride What if what if? If today was your last day And tomorrow was too late Could you say goodbye to yesterday? What if what if? Would you live each moment like your last? Leave old pictures in the past? Donate every dime you have? What if what if? If today was your last day What if what if? If today was your last day Against the grain should be a way of life what is worth the prize is always worth the fight Every second counts ' cause there is no second try So live like you will never live it twice do not take the free ride in your own life What if what if?

Donate every dime you have? What if what if? And would you call old friends you never see? Reminisce old memories? Would you forgive your enemies? What if what if? Would you find that one you are dreaming of? Swear up and down to God above That you finally fall in love? That you finally fall in love If today was your last day If today was your last day Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart? You know it is never too late to shoot for the stars Regardless of who you are So do whatever it takes Takes ' Cause you can not rewind a moment in this life Let nothing stand in your way Way ' Cause the hands of time are never on your side If today was your last day And tomorrow was too late Could you say goodbye to yesterday?

Pink Floyd,Rock,Dogs,Shine On,You got to be crazy you got ta have a real need You got ta sleep on your toes and when you are on the street You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed And then moving in silently down wind and out of sight You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking And after a while you can work on points for style Like the club tie and the firm handshake A certain look in the eye and an easy smile You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to So that when they turn their backs on you you will get the chance to put the knife in You got ta keep one eye looking over your shoulder You know it is going to get harder and harder and harder As you get older and in the end you will pack up and fly down south Hide your head in the sand Just another sad old man All alone and dying of cancer And when you lose control you will reap the harvest you have sown And as the fear grows the bad blood slows and turns to stone And it is too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around So have a good drown as you go down all alone Dragged down by the stone Stone stone stone... Got ta admit that i am a little bit confused Sometimes it seems to me as if i am just being used Got ta stay awake got ta try and shake off this creeping malaise If I do not stand my own ground how can I find my way out of this maze Deaf dumb and blind you just keep on pretending That everyone 's expendable and no one has a real friend And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner Everything 's done under the sun But you believe at heart everyone 's a killer Who was born in a house full of pain Who was trained not to spit in the fan Who was told what to do by the man Who was broken by trained personnel Who was fitted with collar and chain Who was given a pat on the back Who was breaking away from the pack Who was only a stranger at home Who was ground down in the end Who was found dead on the phone Who was dragged down by the stone Who was dragged down by the stone,"['Nostalgia', 'Sadness', 'Solemnity']"

If tomorrow never comes Will she know how much I loved her? Did I try in every way to show her every day That she is my only one?

Johnny Cash,Country,Hurt,American IV: The Man Comes Around,I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that is real The needle tears a hole The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become My sweetest friend?

George Strait,Country,I Saw God Today,Troubadour,Just walked down the street to the coffee shop Had to take a break i have been by her side for eighteen hours straight Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk Pushing up through the concrete Like it was planted right there for me to see The flashing lights The honking horns All seem to fade away But in the shadow of the hospital At 508 I saw God today i have been to church i have read the book I know he is there But I do not look Near as often as I should His fingerprints are everywhere I just look down and stop and stare Open my eyes and then I swear I Saw God Today Saw a couple walking by They were holding hands And she had that glow I could not help But I noticed that she was starting to show Stood there for a minute Taking in the sky Lost in that sunset A splashing down from mounting in shades of red Got my face pushed up against the nursery glass she is sleeping like a rock My name on her wrist Wearing tiny pink socks she is got my nose she is got her Mama 's eyes My brand new baby girl she is a miracle I Saw God Today,"['Amazement', 'Joyful activation', 'Tenderness']"

Difficult preaching is Posdnuos ’ pleasure Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart Something that stimulates the music in my measure Measure in my music raised in three parts Casually see but don ’ t do like the Soul Cause seein ’ and doin ’ are actions for monkeys Doin ’ hip hop hustle no rock and roll Unless your name ’ s Brewster cause Brewster 's a Punk three Parents let go cause there ’ s magic in the air Criticising rap shows you are out of order Stop look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires And don ’ t get offended while Mase ’ s your daughter A tri - camera rolls since our music ’ s now set Fly rhymes are stored on a Da. I. S. Y. production It stands for “ Da Inner Sound Y ’ all ” and y ’ all can bet That the action 's not a trick but showing the function Everybody wants to be a deejay Everybody wants to be an emcee But being speakers are the best And you don ’ t have to guess De Soul posse consists of three And that ’ s the magic number This here piece of the pie Is not dessert but the course that we dine And three out of every darn time The effect is “ ” when a daisy grows in your mind Showing true position this here piece is Kissin ’ the part of the pie that is missin ’ When that negative number fills up the cavity Maybe you can subtract it You can call it your lucky partner Maybe you can call it your adjective But odd as it may be Without my 1 and 2 where would there be My three: Mase Pos and me And that ’ s the Magic Number Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds Common are speakers who honor the scroll Scrolls written daily creates a new sound Listeners listen cause this here is wisdom Wisdom of a Speaker a Dove and a Plug Set aside a legal substance to feed ‘ em For now get ' em high off this dialect drug Time is a factor so it is time that counts Count not the negative actions of one Speakers of soul say it is time to shout Three forms the soul to a positive sum Dance to this fix and flex every muscle Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber Advance to the tune but do not do the hustle Shake rattle roll to my Magic Number Now you may try to subtract it But it just will not go away Three times one? What is it? One two three! And that is a Magic Number what is up? 1 2 3 I say children what does it all mean? - - 1 2 3 I would not lie to you No more no less that is a magic number No more no less What it is?

And if you do Well then do not be afraid to take me by the hand If you want to I think this is how love goes check yes or no "" "" Do you love me do you wanna be my friend?

The Cure,Rock,One Hundred Years,Pornography,It does not matter if we all die Ambition in the back of a black car In a high building there is so much to do Going home time a story on the radio Something small falls out of your mouth and we laugh A prayer for something better A prayer for something better Please love me Meet my mother but the fear takes hold Creeping up the stairs in the dark Waiting for the death blow Waiting for the death blow Waiting for the death blow Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot Fighting for freedom on television Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs Have we got everything? She struggles to get away The pain and the creeping feeling a little black haired girl Waiting for Saturday the death of her father pushing her Pushing her white face into the mirror Aching inside me and turn me ' round Just like the old days Just like the old days Just like the old days Just like the old days Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face Just a piece of new meat in a clean room The soldiers close in under a yellow moon All shadows and deliverance under a black flag A hundred years of blood crimson The ribbon tightens round my throat I open my mouth and my head bursts open A sound like a tiger thrashing in the water Thrashing in the water Over and over we die one after the other Over and over we die one after the other One after the other One after the other One after the other One after the other It feels like a hundred years A hundred years A hundred years A hundred years A hundred years,"['Nostalgia', 'Power', 'Sadness', 'Solemnity', 'Tension']"

When brothers make babies And leave a young mother to be a pappy And since we all came from a woman Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman I wonder why we take from our women Why we rape our women — do we hate our women? I think it is time to kill for our women Time to heal our women be real to our women And if we do not we will have a race of babies That will hate the ladies that make the babies And since a man can not make one He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one So will the real men get up? I know you are fed up ladies but keep ya head up Keep ya head up child Things are gon na get easier Keep ya head up child Things'll get brighter Keep ya head up child Things are gon na get easier Keep ya head up child Things'll get brighter Ayo I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me He had me feeling like black was the thing to be And suddenly the ghetto did not seem so tough And though we had it rough we always had enough I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two And I realize Mama really paid the price She nearly gave her life to raise me right And all I had to give her was my pipe dream Of how i would rock the mic and make it to the bright screen i am trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents it is hard to be legit and still pay the rent And in the end it seems i am heading for the pen I try to find my friends but they are blowing in the wind Last night my buddy lost his whole family it is gon na take the man in me to conquer this insanity It seems the rain'll never let up I try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up You know it is funny when it rains it pours They got money for wars but can not feed the poor Say there am not no hope for the youth And the truth is it am not no hope for the future And then they wonder why we crazy I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby We am not meant to survive ‘ cause it is a set - up And even though you are fed up you got to keep ya head up Keep ya head up child Things are gon na get easier Keep ya head up child Things'll get brighter Keep ya head up child Things are gon na get easier Keep ya head up child Things'll get brighter And to all the ladies having babies on they own I know it is kinda rough and you are feeling all alone Daddy 's long gone and he left you by your lonesome Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want ' em ‘ Cause I think we can make it; in fact i am sure And if you fall stand tall and come back for more ‘ Cause am not nothing worse than when your son Wants to know why his daddy do not love him no mo ' You can not complain you was dealt this Hell of a hand without a man feeling helpless Because there is too many things for you to deal with Dying inside but outside you are looking fearless While tears is rolling down your cheeks You steady hoping things do not fall down this week ‘ Cause if it did you could not take it And do not blame me — I was given this world I did not make it And now my son 's getting older and older And cold from having the world on his shoulders While the rich kids is driving Benz i am still trying to hold on to surviving friends And it is crazy it seems it will never let up But please you got to keep ya head up,"['Nostalgia', 'Sadness', 'Solemnity', 'Tension']"

Be the first to blast Remember Kato no longer with us he is deceased Call on the sirens seen him murdered in the streets Now he rest in peace Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me So many homies in the cemetery shed so many tears I suffered through the years And shed so many tears Lord I lost so many peers And shed so many tears Now that i am struggling in this business by any means Label me greedy getting green but seldom seen And fuck the world ' cause i am cursed i am having visions of leaving here in a hearse God can you feel me? Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain Show me some happiness again i am going blind I spend my time in this cell am not living well I know my destiny is Hell where did I fail? My life is in denial and when I die Baptized in eternal fire shed so many tears Lord I suffered through the years And shed so many tears Lord I lost so many peers And shed so many tears Now i am lost and i am weary so many tears i am suicidal so do not stand near me My every move is a calculated step To bring me closer to embrace an early death Now there is nothing left There was no mercy on the streets I could not rest i am barely standing About to go to pieces screaming peace And though my soul was deleted I could not see it I had my mind full of demons trying to break free They planted seeds and they hatched sparking the flame Inside my brain like a match such a dirty game No memories just a misery Painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep Will I survive ' til the morning to see the sun? Please Lord forgive me for my sins ' cause here I come Lord! God! I suffered through the years And shed so many tears God I lost so many peers And Lord knows I tried been a witness to homicide Seen drive - by 's taking lives little kids die Wonder why as I walk by Broken - hearted as I glance at the chalk line getting high This am not the life for me I wanna change But am not no future bright for me i am stuck in the game i am trapped inside a maze See this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy Disillusioned lately i have been really wanting babies So I could see a part of me that was not always shady do not trust my lady ' cause she is a product of this poison i am hearing noises think she is fucking all my boys can not take no more i am falling to the floor Begging for the Lord to let me in to Heaven 's door Shed so many tears Lord lost so many peers And shed so many tears I lost so many peers And shed so many tears Lord I suffered many years And shed so many tears God I lost so many peers And shed so many tears,"['Calmness', 'Nostalgia', 'Sadness']"

Were you in the yard with your wife and children Or working on some stage in L. A.? Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke Rising against that blue sky? Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor Or did you just sit down and cry? Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones And pray for the ones who do not know? Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble And sob for the ones left below? Did you burst out with pride for the red white and blue And the heroes who died just doing what they do? Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer And look at yourself and what really matters? i am just a singer of simple songs i am not a real political man I watch CNN but i am not sure I can tell You the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us And the greatest is love Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day? Were you teaching a class full of innocent children Or driving down some cold interstate? Did you feel guilty because you are a survivor In a crowded room did you feel alone? Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her? Did you dust off that Bible at home? Did you open your eyes hope it never happened Close your eyes and not go to sleep? Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages Or speak to some stranger on the street? Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow Or go out and buy you a gun? Did you turn off that violent old movie you are watching And turn on "" I Love Lucy "" reruns? Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers Did you stand in line and give your own blood? Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family Thank God you had somebody to love? i am just a singer of simple songs i am not a real political man I watch CNN but i am not sure I can tell You the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us And the greatest is love i am just a singer of simple songs i am not a real political man I watch CNN but i am not sure I can tell You the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us And the greatest is love And the greatest is love And the greatest is love Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?","['Nostalgia', 'Power', 'Sadness', 'Solemnity', 'Tension']"

2Pac,Hip-Hop,Dear Mama,Me Against the World,You are appreciated When I was young me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought i would see her face am not a woman alive that could take my mama 's place Suspended from school and scared to go home I was a fool With the big boys breaking all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister over the years We was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddies the same drama When things went wrong we had blame Mama I reminisce on the stress I caused it was hell Hugging on my mama from a jail cell And who 'd think in elementary i would see the penitentiary one day? And running from the police that is right Mama catch me put a whooping to my backside And even as a crack fiend Mama You always was a black queen Mama I finally understand For a woman it am not easy trying to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare tell me how you did it there is no way I can pay you back but the plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated Lady do not you know we love ya? Dear Mama Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady do not you know we love ya? Now am not nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy ‘ cause the coward was not there He passed away and I did not cry ‘ cause my anger would not let me feel for a stranger They say i am wrong and i am heartless but all along I was looking for a father he was gone I hung around with the thugs And even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hanging I needed money of my own so I started slanging I am not guilty ‘ cause even though I sell rocks It feels good putting money in your mailbox I love paying rent when the rent is due I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you ‘ Cause when I was low you was there for me And never left me alone because you cared for me And I could see you coming home after work late you are in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate You just working with the scraps you was given And Mama made miracles every Thanksgiving But now the road got rough you are alone you are trying to raise two bad kids on your own And there is no way I can pay you back but my plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated Lady do not you know we love ya? Dear Mama Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady do not you know we love ya? Pour out some liquor and I reminisce ‘ Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that i am hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there is no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I got ta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night there is a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on it is a struggle every day got ta roll on And there is no way I can pay you back but my plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated Lady do not you know we love ya? Dear Mama Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady do not you know we love ya? Dear Mama Sweet lady lady Dear Mama Lady lady,"['Nostalgia', 'Sadness', 'Tenderness']"
